# General Component Dependency Tracking

Tracking tool for a general component dependency - think "3rd-party source files, _just_ copied into your project".
This project is meant to complement other solutions, like dependabot, etc. with an additional monitor and reporting layer, not to replace them.


## Overview

The `gcdt.exe` CLI offers several operations to interact with a gcd-store, i.e. a structured data file stored in a central location (e.g. a separate git repository).
